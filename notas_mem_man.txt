C has three types of memory managment:

Automatic: Variables are declared on first use, and they are removed only
when they are out of scope. 

Static: Variables are in the same place through the life of the proogram.
Data is initialized before main starts. Variables declared outside of functions are static. 

Manual: malloc and free. 

When declaring a pointer, it has a memory type, automatic or static. 
But the pointer can point to any type of data. we can have a static pointer
pointing to malloced data, for example
